      <p>One of the things I hear the most lately in the programming world is the holy grail of technology: memory-safe languages. If you don&rsquo;t know, these are languages that, by design, aim to prevent issues like memory leaks and unverified channels. I have strong feelings about these languages, and while I recognize their benefits, I also see significant drawbacks (That are usually ignored by most &ldquo;techbros&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t deny that memory-safe languages have their uses; end-user applications benefit greatly from them, and they can empower less experienced developers by reducing the likelihood of common programming errors. However, this comes at a cost: these languages often implement layers of abstraction that can hinder performance and limit control when you need to operate outside the scope of what the language design allows.</p>
<p>Some might argue, &ldquo;But you should only use these languages in end-user apps, not in low-level programming!&rdquo; The reality is that many advocates of memory-safe languages push to use them in low-level contexts, sometimes resorting to &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; tags to bypass safety features. This usually leads to a umaintainable mess of unsafe tags, and it kinda defeats the porpuse of memory-safe programming in the first place.</p>
<p>The key takeaway is to use the right language for the right project. Don&rsquo;t let the devotion for one specific language blind you from better, faster, and simples alternatives. Write code that works.</p>
