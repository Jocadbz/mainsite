      <p>Since the suddenly AI and the new iterations of LLM&rsquo;s, one of the most prominent statements I&rsquo;ve been reading is: &ldquo;AI will take programmers job&rdquo;. A lot of people are (understandably) are very worried that programmers will lose their jobs and have to restart their career in other fields.
Here are the main reasons why I, personally, think that will never happen.</p>
<h2 id="llms-are-good-at-writing-code-not-understanding-it">LLMs are good at writing code, not understanding it.</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to look very far to see people oneshotting website designs, making little mockup apps with LLMs. Sure sure, that&rsquo;s impressive, but along with the fact that doing those things is a very bad way to demonstrate the quality of a model, <strong>You will never, ever, find similar code or structure on a company&rsquo;s codebase.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>most people think that software engineering is remembering random javascript syntax trivia. but in reality, software engineering is RAWDOGGING google slides and putting up some mfing BOXES AND ARROWS - YacineMTB</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth among most professional codebases, specially if they do not belong to tech companies, is that they are really messy, and hanging on by a thin thread. Redis, PostgresDB, ShadCN, betterAuth and a beautifully structured code? Nah, best we can do is a Perl script a dev wrote while they were drunk and hasn&rsquo;t touched it since 2010.</p>
<p>Your main task, as Yacine noted on his tweet, will be:</p>
<p>1 - Making that shit work.</p>
<p>2 - Document how that shit work.</p>
<p>Pretty rewrites never happen because budget, no time and you must keep that shit working at all times.</p>
<p>Now, why AI can&rsquo;t understand that? Mainly because it takes a human to hack around a codebase. The thing will hallucinate and get really confused when it sees &ldquo;fuck&rdquo;, &ldquo;random_shit&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuckfuckfuck&rdquo; as variable names. And even if it figures out stuff, there will be a shitload of errors, little particularities, little variables that the model can&rsquo;t handle, and therefore will be delegated to you, engineer. Congrats, job secured.</p>
<h2 id="but-but-i-work-at-le-modern-company">But but, I work at le modern company&hellip;</h2>
<p>Sure sure, you work at le modern company, so no random shit, only beautiful code, and you will surely be replaced soon, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Le modern company probably needs you even more than random ass companies need. Sure, you can use AI to write stuff faster, but you still need a shitload of engineers to debug why certain element isn&rsquo;t behaving, why a certain API is 27ms slower than it should. Debugging not only happens on the code, it also happens on the servers, on the machines, on the infra, on basically everything. A human can figure out this. A machine can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And le modern company also cannot be dumb and fire 50% of their workforce and rely purely on LLMs and the other 50% devs. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/pretty-much-everything-important-windows-11-has-broken/">Microsoft tried that out, and you see how that worked out for them.</a> Hell, I can double down: If you integrate LLMs, you probably need 120% of your current workforce to properly take advantage of the increased speed with LLM-assisted development.</p>
<hr>
<p>LLMs are a reality, and an essential part of software development today. Does it mean that you will run out of jobs? No, it does not. LLMs can write things faster, but they can&rsquo;t guarantee reliability, correctness and robustness. At the end of every app, every site, every service, every piece of code, you will still need a dev to make it work.</p>
