If you are confused, let me explain.</p><p>I have a discord bot, and it has a pretty extensive set of features. You can have digital coins, trade them with other people, gamble it all, or invert it on the stock market. (Disclaimer: Not actually the stock market.)</p><p>But what I really think it&rsquo;s funny is how it ended up just like it is today. So, today, grab a chair, and listen to me, the story of my Jack Frost bot.</p><h2 id=how-the-hell-it-was-created>How the hell it was created?</h2><p>This all happened last year. I joined a server, made a few friends, and it was all shit and giggles. Keep in mind by this time, I already had major experience with python and discord.py, so I was pretty much a knowledgeable guy. So, one day, I jokingly proposed to create a discord bot to just spell &ldquo;I WANT BOOBS&rdquo; when &lsquo;boobs&rsquo; was mentioned on the server. So I actually did it. For fun.</p><p>Well, turns out it got really popular. I kept adding and adding stuff, until it was as 378 lines long.</p><p>So, again, for fun, I decided to implement a money system. But there was a problem.</p><h2 id=the-problem>THE PROBLEM</h2><p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know shit aboyt databases, nor I&rsquo;m willing to learn just for a fun side project. So I wondered: How I am going to save folks&rsquo;s money without a database?</p><p>Plain text.</p><p>That&rsquo;s right, plain fucking text. It&rsquo;s actually funny as fuck how it all works under the wraps.</p><p>I have a root profile, called <code>profiles</code>. Inside this folder, every single person who at least spoke in a server with the bot on gets a folder tied to their discord ID. Inside this folder, there is your XP for every server you are, your bio, and of course, your money.</p><p>So yeah, every time we do a transaction regarding user&rsquo;s money, we actually read how much he has (AKA: the file), sums how much we want to give or take for him, and write that stuff again.</p><p>The benefits of this? It&rsquo;s speedy, and allows me to do fun things, like editing other people&rsquo;s money balance, and stuff like this.</p><p>All of those files are on my personal server at home, and not exposed to the internet in any way&mldr; Actually, I should prolly do a backup of those.</p><p>Anyways, thanks for reading.</p></div><footer class=content__footer></footer></section><section class=page__aside><div class=aside__about><div class=aside__about><img class=about__logo src=https://jocadbz.xyz/lain.svg alt=Logo><h1 class=about__title>Jocadbz's Website</h1><p class=about__description>Developer, gamer, and also a fucking idiot</p></div><ul class=aside__social-links><li><a href=https://github.com/jocadbz rel=me aria-label=GitHub title=GitHub><i class="fa-brands fa-github" aria-hidden=true></i></a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=https://x.com/jocadbz rel=me aria-label=X title=X><i class="fa-brands fa-x-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i></a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=mailto:joaquimmadureira@protonmail.com rel=me aria-label=Email title=Email><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope" aria-hidden=true></i></a>&nbsp;</li></ul></div><hr><div class=aside__content><p>My hilarious journey at creating a discord bot</p><p>By Jocadbz,
