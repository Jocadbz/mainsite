This is a fairly decent list of the software I use daily. Some stuff may be subject to change since I will forget about this page often...
        </p>
        <h2>programming</h2>
        <p>
-> <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> - Probably what I use the most. I use it with no modifications, it's quick, fast and pretty good.

-> <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/xed">xed</a> - Used when I need to edit massive codebases and replace a lot of stuff, and when vim isn't fast enough (rarely).

-> <a href="https://github.com/jocadbz/arisu">arisu</a> - Anything AI-related I do, I do through this. Fast, quick, smart and very efficient. Also, nothing better than to use your own software.
        </p>
        <h2>system</h2>
        <p>
-> <a href="https://archlinux.org/">arch</a> - It's my distro of choice since last year. Easy to package to, fast and gets out of my way.

-> <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3m</a> - The best WM in the market btw. All others either try to complicate stuff or just suck. I use it as my main WM since 2022.

-> <a href="https://alacritty.org/">alacritty</a> - Works.

-> <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo">nemo</a> - Imagine a file browser that's fast, efficient, has every internet protocol supported natively and has customizable actions and shortcuts? Yeah, that's nemo. That's what every single DE out there should be using/copying.

-> <a href="https://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/">less</a> - The best file pager of all time.
